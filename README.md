# R-Samples by Bill Back

This repo was started as a way for me to keep examples of how to do various different things with R.  

I started this repo while taking R Programming from Coursera and I plan to continue to update it as I take this
and follow-on courses as well as personal research and study.  I'm putting it on GitHub in case others
might find it useful as well.

The following files are part of this project:

| File name      | Description                                           |
